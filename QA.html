   The story of Lord Rama is told in the epic Ramayana, which is written by the sage Valmiki and is estimated to date back to around 200 B.C.E. The story is about the adventures of Rama, the god-king, and includes the following events: 
Rama's birth
Rama was born in the city of Ayodhya to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya. The gods intended for Rama to be born to defeat the demon king Ravana. 
Rama's marriage
Rama won the hand of Sita, the daughter of a king, in an archery contest. 
Rama's exile
Rama's stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi, tricked King Dasharatha into crowning her son, Bharata, instead of Rama. Rama was banished to the forest for 14 years with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. 
Rama's defeat of Ravana
After several adventures, Rama defeated Ravana with the help of an army of monkeys. 
    Rama's return
Rama returned home after defeating Ravana and was welcomed by the villagers with lights. The festival of lights, Diwali, celebrates Rama's return and the triumph of good over evil.
 It is reported that his birth was due to the bidding of the gods. Vishnu gives King Dasharatha a pot of nectar after being summoned by fire. The pot of nectar is fed to Queen Kausalya, who then gives birth to Rama. Rama's purpose is to defeat the demon Ravana, the King of Lanka
